        <h4> The term AI, coined in the 1950s, refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines. </h4>
        <h5> It covers an ever-changing set of capabilities as new technologies are developed.</h5>
        <h6> It is also more danger to this world</h6>
        <p> Machine learning enables software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. This approach became vastly more effective with the rise of large data sets to train on. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is based on our understanding of how the brain is structured. Deep learning's use of artificial neural networks structure is the underpinning of recent advances in AI, including self-driving cars and ChatGPT.</p>
